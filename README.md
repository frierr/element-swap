Title: "Element Swap"

Objective: The player is presented with a grid of random elements (could be numbers, letters, or shapes). The player must swap adjacent elements to create groups of three or more matching elements in a row or column. The goal is to clear as many elements as possible within a set time limit.

Gameplay: The player clicks on two adjacent elements to swap their positions. If the swap creates a group of three or more matching elements, those elements are removed and the player earns points. The game ends when the time limit runs out or there are no more possible matches.
